let's say if we want to improve the searching functionality. 
before we really doing so, we should consider if it is worthy to do so.
is there a problem with the current searching fuctionality? where should we improve?

Framing problems simply and correctly can often save time later on. 
Thinking about the ultimate purpose of search right off the bat can make it 
easier to evaluate other parts of them problem. Search, at the most basic level, 
is about helping people find what they’re looking for easily. 
A great search product achieves this quickly and with minimal work on behalf of the user.

To understand whether search is fulfilling that purpose, consider some possibilities:

Search use:                 The first thing to understand is whether anyone even uses search at all
Search frequency:           If users search a lot, it’s likely that they’re getting value out of the 
                            feature ‐ with a major exception. If users search repeatedly within a short 
                            timeframe, it’s likely that they’re refining their terms because they were 
                            unable to find what they wanted initially.
Repeated terms:             A better way to understand the above would be to actually compare similarity 
                            of search terms. That’s much slower and more difficult to actually do than counting 
                            the number of searches a user performs in a short timeframe, so best to ignore this option.
Clickthroughs:              If a user clicks many links in the search results, it’s likely that she isn’t having a great 
                            experience. However, the inverse is not necessarily true—clicking only one result does not imply 
                            a success. If the user clicks through one result, then refines her search, that’s certainly not 
                            a great experience, so search frequency is probably a better way to understand that piece of the 
                            puzzle. Clickthroughs are, however, very useful in determining whether search rankings are good. 
                            If users frequently click low results or scroll to additional pages, then the ranking algorithm 
                            should probably be adjusted.



Autocomplete Clickthroughs: The autocomplete feature is certainly part of the equation, though its success should be measured separately to understand its role.
